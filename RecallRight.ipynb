    "In the 1950s, India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement.[270] After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went to war with China in 1962 and was widely thought to have been humiliated.[271] This was followed by another military conflict in 1967 in which India successfully repelled Chinese attack.[272] India has had tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan; the two nations have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the third, the 1971 war, followed from India's support for the independence of Bangladesh.[273] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d'état attempt in the Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[274]\n",

In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. The nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It participates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and other multilateral forums.[276] India has close economic ties with countries in South America,[277] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a \"Look East\" policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations, Japan, and South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and regional security.[278][279]\n",

Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory.[282] India maintains a \"no first use\" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its \"Minimum Credible Deterrence\" doctrine.[283][284] It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, a fifth-generation fighter jet.[285][286] Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of Vikrant-class aircraft carriers and Arihant-class nuclear submarines.[287]\n",

    "Since the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union.[288] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state.[289] India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia,[290] France,[291] the United Kingdom,[292] and Canada.[293]\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an AI framework that combines the strengths of traditional information retrieval systems (such as databases) with the capabilities of generative large language models (LLMs).  By combining this extra knowledge with its own language skills, the AI can write text that is more accurate, up-to-date, and relevant to your specific needs.\n",

    "image of what is RAG\n",
    "35:30\n",
    "Grounding for Gemini with Vertex AI Search and DIY RAG\n",
    "How does Retrieval-Augmented Generation work?\n",
    "RAGs operate with a few main steps to help enhance generative AI outputs: \n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval and Pre-processing: RAGs leverage powerful search algorithms to query external data, such as web pages, knowledge bases, and databases. Once retrieved, the relevant information undergoes pre-processing, including tokenization, stemming, and removal of stop words.\n",
    "Generation: The pre-processed retrieved information is then seamlessly incorporated into the pre-trained LLM. This integration enhances the LLM's context, providing it with a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. This augmented context enables the LLM to generate more precise, informative, and engaging responses. \n",
    "RAG operates by first retrieving relevant information from a database using a query generated by the LLM. This retrieved information is then integrated into the LLM's query input, enabling it to generate more accurate and contextually relevant text. RAG leverages vector databases, which store data in a way that facilitates efficient search and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use RAG?\n",
    "RAG offers several advantages over traditional methods of text generation, especially when dealing with factual information or data-driven responses. Here are some key reasons why using RAG can be beneficial:\n",
    "\n",
    "Access to updated information\n",
    "Traditional LLMs are often limited to their pre-trained knowledge and data. This could lead to potentially outdated or inaccurate responses. RAG overcomes this by granting LLMs access to external information sources, ensuring accurate and up-to-date answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Factual grounding\n",
    "LLMs are powerful tools for generating creative and engaging text, but they can sometimes struggle with factual accuracy. This is because LLMs are trained on massive amounts of text data, which may contain inaccuracies or biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG helps address this issue by providing LLMs with access to a curated knowledge base, ensuring that the generated text is grounded in factual information. This makes RAG particularly valuable for applications where accuracy is paramount, such as news reporting, scientific writing, or customer service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: RAG may also assist in preventing hallucinations being sent to the end user. The LLM will still generate solutions from time to time where its training is incomplete but the RAG technique helps improve the user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contextual relevance\n",
    "The retrieval mechanism in RAG ensures that the retrieved information is relevant to the input query or context.\n",
    "\n",
    "By providing the LLM with contextually relevant information, RAG helps the model generate responses that are more coherent and aligned with the given context.\n",
    "\n",
    "This contextual grounding helps to reduce the generation of irrelevant or off-topic responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Factual consistency\n",
    "RAG encourages the LLM to generate responses that are consistent with the retrieved factual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "By conditioning the generation process on the retrieved knowledge, RAG helps to minimize contradictions and inconsistencies in the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This promotes factual consistency and reduces the likelihood of generating false or misleading information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizes vector databases\n",
    "RAGs leverage vector databases to efficiently retrieve relevant documents. Vector databases store documents as vectors in a high-dimensional space, allowing for fast and accurate retrieval based on semantic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved response accuracy\n",
    "RAGs complement LLMs by providing them with contextually relevant information. LLMs can then use this information to generate more coherent, informative, and accurate responses, even multi-modal ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAGs and chatbots\n",
    "RAGs can be integrated into a chatbot system to enhance their conversational abilities. By accessing external information, RAG-powered chatbots helps leverage external knowledge to provide more comprehensive,informative, and context-aware responses, improving the overall user experience.\"\"\")"

      "Since 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest.[357] Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 78th out of 180 countries in 2018 with a score of 41 out of 100, an improvement from 85th in 2014.[358][359]\n",

India's foreign exchange remittances of US$100 billion in 2022,[313] highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign countries.[314] Major agricultural products include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[13] Major industries include textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software.[13] In 2006, the share of external trade in India's GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985.[309] In 2008, India's share of world trade was 1.7%;[315] In 2021, India was the world's ninth-largest importer and the sixteenth-largest exporter.[316] Major exports include petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and manufactured leather goods.[13] Major imports include crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals.[13] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%.[317] India was the world's second-largest textile exporter after China in the 2013 calendar year.[318]\n",

Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[308] since then, it has moved increasingly towards a free-market system[309][310] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[311] India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.[312]\n",
